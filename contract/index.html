            <h3>Release and Waiver of Liability</h3>
            <p>WHEREAS, Filled out from the input field [name of Company or Service Provider] (“Company”), Florida Limited Liability Company is the owner/operator/sponsor of an activity ________WATER SPORT TRAINING __________ [description of activity] (the “Activity”) and is willing to permit the individuals (the “Invitees”) signing this Agreement to participate in the Activity, upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement. All or some of the Activity may take place on the Company’s premises or property (the “Premises”) located at ______________________________________________________________ [location].</p>
            <p>The Company and Invitees may be collectively referred to as (the “Parties”). 
                In consideration for being provided the ability to participate in the Activity and enter the Premises, each person signing below hereby stipulates and agrees:
            </p>
            <h4>Use of Premises for Activity Only. </h4>
            <p>I understand and agree that I may only use the Premises for the Activity set forth in this Release and Waiver of Liability agreement at the following date(s) and time: [date(s) and hours the Invitees will be permitted to use the Premises]. I further agree that I am responsible for the proper use and care of the 
                Premises and any of Company’s property thereon.</p>
            <h4>Assumption of Risk. </h4>
            <p>I understand and acknowledge that the Activity I want to participate in may be dangerous and may involve the risk that I will sustain serious injury, temporary or permanent disability, death, and/or property damage. I understand that the Activity may not be supervised and that the Company does not provide medical services. I further acknowledge that any injury I may sustain while participating in the Activity may be compounded by negligent or delayed medical service or negligent or delayed assistance by the Company. I VOLUNTARILY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL RISKS AND DANGERS THAT MAY OCCUR PURSUANT TO MY USE OF THE PREMISES AND PARTICPATION IN ACTIVITIES ON THE PREMISES, INCLUDING THE RISK OF INJURY, DEATH, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, EVEN IF CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE OF THE COMPANY.</p>
            <h4>Release from Liability. </h4>
            <p>I hereby agree, on behalf of myself, my heirs and my personal representatives, to fully and forever discharge and release Company and its affiliates, and their respective partners, agents, operators, managers, employees, and representatives (“Released Parties”) from any and all claims I may have or hereinafter have for any injury, temporary or permanent disability, death, damages, liabilities, expenses and/or causes of action, now known or hereinafter known in any jurisdiction in the world, attributable or relating in any manner to my entry upon and use of the Premises and participation in the Activity, whether caused by the negligence of the Company or any of the Released Parties or by any other reason. I acknowledge and agree that this Release and Waiver of Liability for a Potentially Dangerous Activity is intended to be, and is, a complete release, as much as allowed by law, of any responsibility of the Released Parties for all personal injuries, temporary or permanent disability, death, and/or property damage sustained by me while on or using the Premises or participating in the Activity.</p>
            <h4>Covenant Not to Sue. </h4>
            <p>I agree, for myself and all my heirs, not to sue the Released Parties or initiate or assist in the prosecution of any claim for damages or cause of action against the Released Parties which I or my heirs may have as a result of any personal injury, death or property damage I may sustain while on or using the Premises or while participating in the Activity.</p>
            <h4>Indemnification. </h4>
            <p>I hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Company and the Released Parties from and against any third-party losses, damages, actions, suits, claims, judgments, settlements, awards, interest, penalties, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and costs of any kind for any personal injury, loss of life or damage to property sustained by reason of or arising out of my use of the Premises or participation in any Activities on the Premises.</p>
            <h4>Medical Treatment Release. </h4>
            <p>I hereby authorize the Company to secure, and I consent to, any medical treatment that may be given to me should the Company determine, in its sole discretion, that I need medical care, as a result of my being on the Premises or from participating in the Activity. I accept full responsibility for all costs related to my medical treatment, including any transport costs, and I release all parties involved from any type of liability for anything that may happen during my treatment or transport. </p>
            <h4>Responsibility for Personal Property. </h4>  
            <p>I acknowledge and agree that I am fully and solely responsible for any of my property and personal belongings that I bring onto the Premises or that I use during the Activity, and that the Company will not be responsible for or provide any security for my property and personal belongings.</p>
            <h4>No Representations by Company. </h4>
            <p>I acknowledge that Company makes no representation as to the condition of the Premises or the safety of the Activity or any equipment either on the Premises or used in the Activity. I accept and shall use the Premises, and its equipment, in its “AS IS” condition. I acknowledge and agree that I am not relying upon any representation or statement by the Company or the Company’s employees, agents, sponsors, or representatives regarding this agreement or the Premises or Activity, except to the extent such representations are expressly set forth in this agreement.</p>
            <h4>Governing Law and Venue. </h4>
